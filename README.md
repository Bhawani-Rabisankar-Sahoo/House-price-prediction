# House-price-prediction
## Aim
Predicting the best possible price for a house based on  various parameters .
## Approach

## Data Cleaning

- First data  cleaning 

- It includes dealing with outliers and missing values 
## EDA

- Second part is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) .

- Here we'll explore the data to get as much insights we can get from  it.
## Model Building

- Here we'll feed the cleaned data to the machine learnning model to predict the future senario.
## Results 

So as we can see from the correlation matrix  that the 'median_house_value' has a -0.48 correlation with the houses that are inland and like wise it has a positive correlation of 0.28 with the houses that are near to the coast/ocean.
